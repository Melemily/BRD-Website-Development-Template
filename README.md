# BRD-Website-Development-Template
Business Requirement Document Example for Small Business Website

This template is based on consulting work for small business and start-ups I have done. It is very bare-bones and does not encompass full scope project details so as to comply with NDA's, but it is a brief overview to help understand my process when a business requests assistance with their websites. 

Feel free to use the general outline as a template.
